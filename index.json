In this work, we propose an experimental study of the costs (in terms of gate number and execution time on a idealised hardware created from realistic gate data) associated with one of the “direct” quantum algorithm: the wave equation solver devised in [Costa, P.C., Jordan, S. and Ostrander, A., 2019. Quantum algorithm for simulating the wave equation. Physical Review A, 99(1), p.012323.]. We show that our implementation of the quantum wave equation solver agrees with the theoretical big-O complexity of the algorithm. We also explain in great detail the implementation steps and discuss some possibilities of improvements. Finally, our implementation proves experimentally that some PDE can be solved on a quantum computer, even if the direct quantum algorithm chosen will require error-corrected quantum chips, which are not believed to be available in the short-term.","tags":["wave equation","quantum","pde","solver","implementation"],"title":"Practical Quantum Computing: Solving the Wave Equation Using a Quantum Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siyuan Niu","Adrien Suau","Gabriel Staffelbach","Aida Todri-Sanial"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"49b9fd0a2d7678df027cee5c9569a61d","permalink":"https://quantumontpellier.github.io/publication/20-09-24-qubit-mapping/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/20-09-24-qubit-mapping/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to several physical limitations in the realization of quantum hardware, today's quantum computers are qualified as noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. NISQ hardware is characterized by a small number of qubits (50 to a few hundred) and noisy operations. Moreover, current realizations of superconducting quantum chips do not have the ideal all-to-all connectivity between qubits but rather at most a nearest-neighbor connectivity. All these hardware restrictions add supplementary low-level requirements. They need to be addressed before submitting the quantum circuit to an actual chip. Satisfying these requirements is a tedious task for the programmer. Instead, the task of adapting the quantum circuit to a given hardware is left to the compiler. In this article, we propose a hardware-aware (HA) mapping transition algorithm that takes the calibration data into account with the aim to improve the overall fidelity of the circuit. Evaluation results on IBM quantum hardware show that our HA approach can outperform the state of the art, both in terms of the number of additional gates and circuit fidelity.","tags":["qubit mapping","quantum","compiler"],"title":"A Hardware-Aware Heuristic for the Qubit Mapping Problem in the NISQ Era","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://quantumontpellier.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://quantumontpellier.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://quantumontpellier.github.io/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"}]
